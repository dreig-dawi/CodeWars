What a bunch of cheapskates!

Can you do it?

Kata
Given the angle (in degrees) of the hour-hand, return the time in 12 hour HH:MM format. Round down to the nearest minute.

Examples
12:00 = 0 degrees

03:00 = 90 degrees

06:00 = 180 degrees

09:00 = 270 degrees

12:00 = 360 degrees

Notes
0 <= angle <= 360

Do not make any AM or PM assumptions for the HH:MM result. They are indistinguishable for this Kata.

3 o'clock is 03:00, not 15:00
7 minutes past midnight is 12:07
7 minutes past noon is also 12:07
